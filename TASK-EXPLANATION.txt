USER ACTIVITY TRACKER - useEffect Quiz Implementation
=====================================================

This app demonstrates correct and intentional use of useEffect with 5 key concepts:

1. PAGE LOAD TRACKING (useEffect + [])
   - Concept: Effect runs once on component mount
   - Implementation: useEffect(() => { console.log('Page loaded'); }, [])
   - Console output: "Page loaded" (appears only once)

2. BUTTON CLICK COUNTER (Event Handler)
   - Concept: Events vs Effects - using event handlers, NOT useEffect
   - Implementation: handleIncrease() function with onClick
   - State updates via setCount() in event handler

3. REACT TO STATE CHANGE (useEffect with dependency)
   - Concept: Effect runs when specific state changes
   - Implementation: useEffect(() => { console.log('Count updated'); }, [count])
   - Condition: if (count > 0) to avoid logging on initial render
   - Console output: "Count updated" (only when count changes)

4. UPDATE DOCUMENT TITLE (Side effect outside React)
   - Concept: DOM manipulation as side effect
   - Implementation: useEffect(() => { document.title = `Count: ${count}`; }, [count])
   - Updates browser tab title whenever count changes

5. TIMER WITH CLEANUP (Cleanup function)
   - Concept: Proper resource cleanup to prevent memory leaks
   - Implementation: useEffect with setInterval and cleanup function
   - Cleanup: return () => clearInterval(intervalId)
   - Starts/stops with "Start Tracking"/"Stop Tracking" button

6. CONDITIONAL EFFECT (useEffect + condition)
   - Concept: Effect runs conditionally based on state
   - Implementation: useEffect(() => { if (isTracking) console.log('Tracking active'); }, [isTracking])
   - Only logs when tracking is active

KEY LEARNING POINTS:
====================
✓ useEffect with empty array [] runs once on mount
✓ useEffect with dependencies [state] runs when that state changes
✓ Event handlers (onClick) are for user interactions, not useEffect
✓ Cleanup functions prevent memory leaks
✓ Conditional logic inside effects controls when they run
✓ Document side effects (like title changes) belong in useEffect

TESTING:
========
1. Open browser console to see logs
2. Click "Increase Count" button - see count increase and "Count updated" log
3. Watch document title change to "Count: X"
4. Click "Start Tracking" - timer starts, "Tracking active" logs
5. Click "Stop Tracking" - timer stops, no more logs
6. "Page loaded" should appear only once in console

RESTRICTIONS FOLLOWED:
======================
✓ Only functional components used
✓ No external libraries
✓ No effects triggered in click handlers
✓ No infinite loops
✓ Proper cleanup implemented
